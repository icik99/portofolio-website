## My Role  
![Website Screenshot](/train-wheels-detection/2.png)  

As a **System Analyst** and **Fullstack Developer**, I contributed to this project by:  

- **System Analysis and Planning:**  
  Defining the data requirements, workflows, and predictive modeling pipeline to ensure the system meets user needs.  

- **Backend Development:**  
  Building the backend using **Flask** for efficient data processing and integration with machine learning models.  

- **Frontend Development:**  
  Designing user-friendly input forms and result displays using **HTML** and **TailwindCSS**.  

- **Database Management:**  
  Configuring and managing the database with **Supabase** to store and retrieve training data and predictions.  

- **Deployment:**  
  Deploying the application for reliable and secure access to users.  

## Key Features  

1. **Predictive Modeling:**  
   Users can input a dataset of wheel sensor readings, the travel distance in kilometers, and the wheel diameter. The platform predicts when significant wear is likely to occur.  

2. **Machine Learning Integration:**  
   Trained models analyze historical data to provide accurate predictions and support proactive maintenance decisions.  

3. **Data Upload and Visualization:**  
   Allows users to upload datasets and view processed results, including visualized predictions for easy interpretation.  

4. **Responsive Design:**  
   Ensures usability across various devices and screen sizes for field and office applications.  

## Technologies Used  

- **Framework:** Flask  
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Styling:** TailwindCSS  
- **Database:** Supabase  
- **Machine Learning:** Python libraries (e.g., scikit-learn, pandas)  
- **Deployment:** Vercel or an equivalent platform  

## Impact  

This project highlights my ability to integrate advanced data science techniques with intuitive web interfaces. By providing reliable predictions for train wheel wear, this platform supports proactive maintenance, minimizes downtime, and enhances operational safety in railway systems.
